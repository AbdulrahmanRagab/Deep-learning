## Description

This project implements a **linear regression model** using TensorFlow to predict values based on a given dataset. The dataset consists of two arrays, `x` and `y`, which represent the input and output values, respectively. The model is trained to learn the relationship between `x` and `y` and make predictions.

### Key Steps:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
   - The input data (`x`) and output data (`y`) are prepared as TensorFlow tensors.

2. **Model Building**:
   - A simple neural network is created using TensorFlow's `Sequential` API.
   - The model consists of a single dense layer with one neuron, which is typical for linear regression.

3. **Model Compilation**:
   - The model is compiled with:
     - **Loss Function**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to measure the difference between predicted and actual values.
     - **Optimizer**: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to update the model's weights.
     - **Metrics**: MAE is used to evaluate the model during training.

4. **Model Training**:
   - The model is trained on the training data for a specified number of epochs.
   - The training process minimizes the loss function to improve the model's accuracy.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The model's performance is evaluated on the test data using MAE and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
   - Predictions are visualized using Matplotlib to compare the actual and predicted values.

6. **Visualization**:
   - Plots are generated to visualize the training data, test data, and model predictions.

## Features

- **Data Preparation**: Splits data into training and testing sets.
- **Model Building**: Creates a simple neural network using TensorFlow's `Sequential` API.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Trains the model and evaluates its performance using MAE and MSE.
- **Visualization**: Uses Matplotlib to plot the data and predictions.

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the linear regression model.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data handling (though not heavily used in this example).

## Results

The model is trained on a simple dataset and evaluated on a test set. The results include:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.

Visualizations show the training data, test data, and model predictions.
