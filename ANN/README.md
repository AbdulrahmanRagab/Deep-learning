## Description

This project implements a linear regression model using TensorFlow to predict values based on a given dataset. The dataset consists of two arrays, `x` and `y`, which represent the input and output values, respectively. The model is trained to learn the relationship between `x` and `y` and make predictions.

Key steps include:
- Data preparation and splitting into training and testing sets.
- Building and compiling a TensorFlow model.
- Training the model and evaluating its performance.
- Visualizing the results using Matplotlib.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and TensorFlow installed. Follow these steps:

1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Install TensorFlow**:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
   ```

4. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the provided Python script to train the model and visualize the results:
   ```bash
   python linear_regression_example.py
   ```

2. **Model Training**:
   The script trains a linear regression model using TensorFlow. It uses Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as the optimizer and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the loss function.

3. **Visualization**:
   The script generates plots to visualize the training data, test data, and model predictions.

## Features

- **Data Preparation**: Splits data into training and testing sets.
- **Model Building**: Creates a simple neural network using TensorFlow's `Sequential` API.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Trains the model and evaluates its performance using MAE and MSE.
- **Visualization**: Uses Matplotlib to plot the data and predictions.

---

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the linear regression model.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data handling (though not heavily used in this example).

---

## Results

The model is trained on a simple dataset and evaluated on a test set. The results include:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.

Visualizations show the training data, test data, and model predictions.
